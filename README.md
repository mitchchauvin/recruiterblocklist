Recruiter Block List

This is a comprehensive list of recruiters that anyone can use freely to block recruiters, in their email accounts (hotmail, gmail, yahoo, etc) or by developers in their Android and iOS apps!

## Why is this list needed?
Anyone who has posted their resume online knows that within a matter of days you will start to get calls and emails 10-20 times a day from:
  - bad/unprofessional recruiters, and/or
  - international recruiters pretending to be local using virtual numbers and virtual offices, and/or
  - recruiters playing the numbers game by blasting out any and all irrelevant jobs, and/or
  - greedy recruiters that seem nice but are only in it for themselves and will totally rip you and the company you work for off.

Recruiter contracts have become as bad a cell-phone contracts that:
  - held you hostage by locking you phone to the cellular provider network, and
  - only unlocked your phone for a absurdly high fee, and
  - locked people into contracts perpetually by offering new devices near the end of a contractor in order to lock the customer into another contract, and
  - charged you far more than the value of the phone over the course of your perpetual contracts, and
  - imposed all sorts of rules and penalties if you tried to get out of your contract and buy out your phone.
  
People spoke up and changes were made. Now it's time for people to speak out against recruiters!

We are long overdue for better laws and regulations of the recruiting industry that:
  - prevent recruiters from perpetually charging fees forever, and
  - prevent recruiters from charging a percentage of your salary or hourly rate, and
  - prevent recruiters from locking you into a contract that doesn't permit you to work for directly for a company using blackout periods, and
  - prevent recruiters from charging absurd fees, and
  - prevent recruiters from telling you and the company that neither of you can discuss your contracts (because you might find out how much you are being ripped off).

## What is the purpose of this list?
Build a comprehensive list of all recruiters to help job seekers filter out all the annoying mail. In the future the plan is to build an open database with domains, emails, names and phone numbers of recruiters and potentially apps for smart phones that will block emails and calls in real-time.
