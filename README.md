# Recruiter Block List

Welcome to the Recruiter Block List!

This is the most extensive, freely available, list of recruiters domains available on the internet!

The Recruiter Block List can be used by:
  - JOB SEEKERS: to block recruiting companies by blocking recruiter domains in their Hotmail, Gmail or Yahoo accounts.
  - APP DEVELOPERS: to develop Android and iOS apps that can block recruiter in real-time in their apps.

We aim to have the most comprehensive and up-to-date list of recruiter domains on the planet so you don't have to suffer anymore!

## Why is this list needed?
Anyone who has posted their resume online knows that within a matter of days you will start to get calls and emails 10-20 times a day from:
  - bad/unprofessional recruiters, and/or
  - international recruiters pretending to be local using virtual numbers and virtual offices, and/or
  - recruiters playing the numbers game by blasting out any and all irrelevant jobs, and/or
  - greedy recruiters that seem nice but are only in it for themselves and will totally rip you and the company you work for off.

These days most people receive email on their cell phone and are therefore interrupted as soon as a recruiter emails or calls them. Only a small fraction of the emails and calls are actually relevant because a lot of bad recruiters are playing the numbers game or robo-dialing/robo-emailing irrelevant jobs to candidates. I've seen some companies email the same job multiple times from different emails to ensure it gets through your spam filters and I've received the same job >20 times from various recruiters and firms. Answering or deleting these endless calls and emails can become extremely time consuming and frustrating. The productivity hit due to the time wasted on irrelevant spam emails and calls is huge and something needed to be done to stop it.

... then the Recruiter Block List was born... and there was peace and quiet once again!

Now you too can stop all the irrelevant recruiter spam and only receive the emails that are important to you thanks to the Recruiter Block List!

## How do I use the recruiter block list?
  - Block recruiter domains in Hotmail: http://800emailsupport.com/blog/add-email-address-block-list-hotmail/
  - Block recruiter domains in Gmail: https://support.google.com/a/answer/2364632
  - Block recruiter domains in Android Mail: comming soon!
  - Developers can use the list in their Android or iOS apps!

## Want to help us maintain the list?
You can help in one of two ways. Add recruiter's domains to the list to keep the list up-to-date or email the domain to us.
  1. Check out the repo.
  2. Add a recruitment firm's domain to the list using the script "add_domain.py".
    a. cd into <repo>/scripts
    b. ./add_domain <new_recruiter_domain>
  3. Add, commit and push back your changes.

## Future work
  - Develop and Android or iOS app that blocks emails from recruiters in real-time on smartphone devices.
  - Develop a website where:
    - people can submit new recruiters to block to a database, and
    - developers can query the website to see if an email or domain is in the database and should be blocked.
  - Add phone recruiters's phone numbers to the list/database and block phone numbers in real-time on smartphones.
